Functioning:
-----------
- A ship move left to right on arrow key input
- Ship can shoot bullets. Maximum of 10 bullets can exist on screen at any given time
- Ship initially has 5 lives
- Ship is not affected if enemies collide with it

- Bullets are updated at regular intervals
- Bullets have a specific target. when shot by the ship, this target is straight ahead
- Bullets collide with stuff, and whatever the collide with loses one life

- Enemies move weirdly: They move down at the same time, but their sidewards motion is completely independent of eachother
- Ex:
	
	+-------------------+           +-------------------+
	|  X            X   |           |   ↓           ↘   |
	|  ↓      X      ↘  |           |   X     ↙      X  |
	|        ↙          |    -->    |        X          |  
	|                   |           |                   |
	|                   |           |                   |
	+-------------------+           +-------------------+
- Enemies are to be destroyed when colliding with a bullet
- Enemies are to two types: big (3 lives) and small (1 life)
- Scores earned are: big (10 points) small (5 points)
- Enemies crossing over to lower edge of screen makes player lose as many lives as enemy has
- Enemy can also shoot bullets directly aimed at you.

- As waves increase, number of enemies increases by 10
- In each successive wave, higher fraction of enemies is big, it is 0 for first 2 wave
- In first wave, there are only 10 enemies

Extras:
- Bonus rounds, where 100x points are given, but enemies are twice as fast, and a single enemy crossing over means certain death
- In between two waves, bonus rounds are given, optionally
- Option to avoid Bonus round, by pressing n, when asked
- VERY RARE: health bonus with kill: on killing an enemy, there may rarely be a health bonus, giving you one life increase.
- Increased frequency of health boosts in bonus mode
